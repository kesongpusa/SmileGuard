## 📌 Priority

## 📌 Suggestions by Ser Che

- [ ] Develop AI-driven anomaly detection for dental images:
  - [ ] Detect cavities, cracks, discoloration, gingivitis, mouth ulcers, lesions, and inflammation.
  - [ ] Highlight affected areas with markers (e.g., crosshair/green target).
  - [ ] Provide AI-driven analysis output that identifies issues clearly.
- [ ] Ensure the AI captures both top and bottom teeth images, including incisors.
- [ ] Train the AI to act like a "first doctor" — preliminary screening before the dentist.
- [ ] Use cellphone BACK camera for capturing mouth images → upload → AI analyzes.
- [ ] Implement a retake mechanism (like Shopee's live feedback) if images are unclear.
- [ ] Generate suggestive outputs (e.g., "possible gingivitis," "needs cleaning") for:
  - [ ] Dentist (to prepare before appointment).
  - [ ] Patient (to understand condition before visiting clinic).
- [ ] Detect if a tooth has been extracted ("nabunutan") and reflect that in analysis.
- [ ] Provide real-time or near real-time feedback where possible.
- [ ] Integrate with appointment scheduling:
  - [ ] Payment modes and discounts (PWD, senior citizen).
  - [ ] Allow upload of proof documents (e.g., PWD/senior ID) → automatic discount application.
- [ ] Ensure dentist sees patient history and AI suggestions before consultation.
- [ ] Decide on backend: Firebase or MongoDB (both acceptable).
- [ ] Implement double database setup:
  - [ ] Cloud database (Firebase/MongoDB).
  - [ ] Local backup database for offline use when internet is down.
  - [ ] Sync mechanism: transactions saved locally → auto-update to cloud once reconnected.
- [ ] Handle transaction errors (e.g., "transaction not completed" when internet drops).
- [ ] Ensure real-time syncing between local and cloud when connection resumes.

## 📌 Deliverables & Deadlines

- [ ] Terminal system must be ready before defense.
- [x] At least two objectives accomplished before defense.
- [ ] Prepare a consultation form documenting progress and features.
- [ ] Prioritize hard parts first (AI detection, appointment/payment integration).
- [ ] Next week: show consultation form and progress on cleaning module.

## 🔐 Security Review Fixes *(Code Review — 2026-02-21)*

### 🚨 Critical — Fix before any production/public deployment

- [ ] **`lib/supabase.ts:8-9`** — Move Supabase URL + anon key out of source code into environment variables.
  Currently the credentials are hardcoded and committed to git.
  **How to fix:**
  1. Create `.env` → `SUPABASE_URL=...` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...`
  2. In `app.json` add: `"extra": { "supabaseUrl": process.env.SUPABASE_URL, ... }`
  3. In `lib/supabase.ts` use: `Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.supabaseUrl`

- [ ] **`components/auth/AuthModal.tsx:244`** — Replace hardcoded `VALID_DOCTOR_CODES` array with a Supabase Edge Function call.
  The codes are embedded in the JS bundle and can be extracted by anyone with a decompiler.
  The `doctor_access_codes` DB table already exists — wire it up via an Edge Function.
  **How to fix:**
  ```ts
  const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke("verify-doctor-code", {
    body: { code: formData.doctorAccessCode },
  });
  if (!data?.valid) { /* reject */ }
  ```

### ⚠️ Warning — Fix before launch

- [ ] **`hooks/useAuth.ts:12`** — Add `.catch(() => setLoading(false))` to the `getSession()` call.
  A network error or storage corruption currently leaves `loading=true` forever, freezing the app on a blank screen.

- [ ] **`hooks/useAuth.ts:50`** — Replace silent `console.error` in `fetchProfile` catch block with user-facing error handling (e.g., show an alert or set an error state).

- [ ] **`components/auth/AuthModal.tsx:199`** — Persist login lockout state (`lockoutUntil`, `loginAttempts`) to `AsyncStorage` keyed by email.
  Currently stored in React state — closing/reopening the modal resets it to zero, bypassing brute-force protection.
  Alternatively, enable Supabase's built-in Auth rate limiting in the dashboard (Auth → Settings → Rate Limits).

- [ ] **`supabase/setup.sql:319-323`** — Fix RLS self-referencing subquery in the profiles `UPDATE` policy `WITH CHECK` clause.
  The subquery queries `public.profiles` while RLS is active on that table, risking recursion.
  Replace with a `SECURITY DEFINER` helper function or read role from `auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata' ->> 'role'`.

### 💡 Suggestion

- [ ] **`.gitignore:39`** — Update `.gitignore` to also ignore plain `.env` files.
  Currently only `.env*.local` is ignored — a standard `.env` would be committed.
  **Add:**
  ```
  .env
  .env.*
  !.env.example
```
